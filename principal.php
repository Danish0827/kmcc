                            <p>It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to our college website...</p>
                            <p>Dear Parents, students and well-wishers of the KMCC family - Greetings. First and foremost I would like to express my deep feelings of gratitude to every one of you for your constant support, love and concern towards the college which enables and encourages us to strive hard to carry forward the mission of spreading value-based knowledge to one and all.</p>
                            <p >I am extremely impressed by the commitment of the college and the staff to the establishment of an excellent all-round education for our students in our facilities. As a team working together, we strongly promote academic achievement among our students. The dept. of NSS, cultural, sports and other successes of all of our students and staff are also proudly celebrated together.</p>
                            <p>Education is a life-long learning process. Learning happens at all the phases; not only at home but also at place at the College. Shaping young, suggestible minds is one of life’s biggest challenges. At SKMCC, we aim to empower our students to grow as individuals with strong open perceptive minds with an international perspective, preparing them to make a mark in the global community – the world has come to be today.</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">We are a unique college drawing on the talents and skills of staff and students. Our academic programmes and teaching methodologies encourage students to develop critical-thinking and learn through query and purpose, to exchange thoughts and ideas, to develop key personal and social values, to take ownership for his/ her choices and to set goals to realize their own unique potential.</p>
                            <p>Teacher-student relationships take time to develop and deepen and need a climate of love and trust. There must also be continuity between teachers and students both within the classroom and in the wider college atmosphere.</p>
                            <p>We endeavour to provide an atmosphere that is basically blessed, and has a framework of discipline that is flexible yet supportive, a freedom that allows students to learn even from their mistakes, to develop into a person moulded by responsibility.</p>
                            <p>We value exploding the spark of creativity and curiosity in our students.</p>
